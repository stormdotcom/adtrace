Detailed Description (paste this verbatim)
AdTrace is a developer-grade ad blocker built for web professionals who need to both block ads AND understand what the ad layer is doing.

Unlike regular ad blockers, AdTrace gives you full DevTools-level visibility into every blocked request — perfect for auditing client sites, debugging ad integrations, or understanding what trackers a site runs.

─── FEATURES ───

▸ LIVE BLOCK LOG
Every blocked network request logged in real time with URL, resource type, matched rule attribution, and timestamp. Filter by category: Ads, Trackers, Social Pixels.

▸ DEVTOOLS PANEL
A dedicated panel inside Chrome DevTools (open DevTools → AdTrace tab) showing a full request table, 60-second timeline, and detail pane. Click any request to see the full URL, matched rule, filter pattern, and take action instantly.

▸ DEV OVERLAY MODE
Toggle a visual overlay that highlights blocked ad elements on the page with cyan outlines and ADTRACE BLOCKED badges — see exactly what was hidden and where.

▸ SIMULATE USER VIEW
One click to see the page exactly as a regular (non-dev) user would, with all ads visible. Toggle back to dev view instantly.

▸ DOMAIN OVERRIDES
Allow or hard-block any domain with one click. Localhost and 127.0.0.1 are automatically whitelisted so your dev environment always works.

▸ CUSTOM RULES
Write your own network filter rules (AdBlock syntax: ||domain.com^) and cosmetic CSS rules (##.selector) with live apply — no page reload needed for cosmetic rules.

▸ BLOCK REPORTS
Export a full JSON or CSV report of every blocked request on a page — useful for auditing what ad networks and trackers a client site is running.
